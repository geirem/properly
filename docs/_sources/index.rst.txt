Welcome to Properly's documentation!
====================================

**Properly** is not a Python library for cooks and food lovers that
creates recipes mixing random ingredients.  It does not pull data from the `Open Food
Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_ and offers no *simple* and
*intuitive* API.
