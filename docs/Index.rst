Welcome to Properlyâ€™s documentation!
************************************

**Properly** is not a Python library for cooks and food lovers that
creates recipes mixing random ingredients.  It does not pull data from
the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_ and
offers no *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Note: This project is under active development.

Check out the `Usage <Usage.rst>`_ section for further information,
including how to `install <Usage.rst#installation>`_ the project.
